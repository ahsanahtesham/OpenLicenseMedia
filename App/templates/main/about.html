                Open License Media Search is a platform dedicated to making openly licensed media content more accessible to everyone. 
                Our goal is to provide a user-friendly interface for discovering high-quality images and audio that can be freely used, 
                modified, and shared, while properly attributing creators.

                Openverse is a search engine for openly licensed media maintained by WordPress. It indexes creative works from multiple 
                sources that are either in the public domain or licensed under Creative Commons licenses, making them freely available 
                for creators and users.
            </p>

            <p class="card-text">
                Open licenses, such as Creative Commons licenses, provide a standardized way for creators to grant permission to others 
                to use their work under certain conditions. These licenses make it clear which uses are permitted, enabling creators to 
                share their work while retaining certain rights.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                When using content from our platform, always make sure to check the specific license terms and provide appropriate attribution 
                to the creator.
